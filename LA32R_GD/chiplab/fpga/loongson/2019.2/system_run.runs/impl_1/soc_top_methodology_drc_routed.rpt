2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_out2_clk_pll_33 and clk_pll_i are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell cpu_mid/u_mem_stage/idle_lock_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) cpu_mid/u_if_stage/idle_lock_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

The auto-derived clock clk_out2_clk_pll_33 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 18 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_pll_33/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#11 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out2_clk_pll_33 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 19 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_pll_33/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#12 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_pll_i is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 11 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins mig_axi/u_mig_axi_32_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/gen_mmcm.mmcm_i/CLKFBOUT]

TIMING-47#1 Warning
False path, asynchronous clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between synchronous clocks  
A False Path timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks clk_out1_clk_pll_33 and clk_out2_clk_pll_33 (see constraint position 15 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via  set_false_path, set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#2 Warning
False path, asynchronous clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between synchronous clocks  
A False Path timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks clk_out2_clk_pll_33 and clk_out1_clk_pll_33 (see constraint position 14 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via  set_false_path, set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#3 Warning
False path, asynchronous clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between synchronous clocks  
A False Path timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks clk_pll_i and clk_out2_clk_pll_33 (see constraint position 11 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via  set_false_path, set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only may result in failure in hardware.

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '4' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

Existing latches in the design  
There are 849 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
